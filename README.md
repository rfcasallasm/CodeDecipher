## Algoritmo multidimensional para la extracción y visualización de conocimiento a partir de código fuente

This project contains the first version of the specialization project document [
Multidimensional algorithm for the extraction and visualization of the architecture of a software artifact from the source code
](http://repository.udistrital.edu.co/handle/11349/15776). 

## Abstract

It has been documented in the scientific literature that software visualization tools improve the process of understanding a software unknown artifact, this work proposes a software visualization algorithm based on a theoretical and practical analysis of the desirable and possible aspects to be extracted from the source code and its corresponding visual representation using elements such as size, shape, color, distance and navigation, also the preliminary results of the prototype and future work prospective are presented.

## Future work

Probably I'll start a new repo trying to support other programming languajes, or even microservices. But, the base **principle** will be the same:

Extract information about:

* The static structure
* The dinamic behaviour
* The colaborative evolution

Parse and build a beautiful and useful visual representation that provides insights and at least a clear architectural aid.
